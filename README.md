# Verifa

The project is still in progress ....

General idea of the project :
  -User can upload/create a database with a persone information (and his mail)
  -Creating a unique hash of the details of each person in the database, and sending them a mail with a QR Code of the hash
  -The User that created the database can now scan each QR and get the details of the person if he is the database.
  
  
The use of such an 'app' could be tickets of festivals or verification of identity cars

***What we currently have***
We have an already created csv (not created by a user), the hash is only a random number and there is not mail. 
Each hash can be verified, and if in the data, it will display the details of the person.
